# Introduction

The way humans connect to each other epidemiologically shapes the way diseases spread amongst them. This is because it makes easier or harder for pathogens to “jump” from host to host and continue their path of infection. This is why, our project focuses on trying to obtain and analyse human connections to try to infer the way Zika would spread in a given population and how we would better approach its eradication.

# Research Lines

Being a large-scale project, this code is divided into three main lines of research that allow a certain level of independence amongst them.

## Individual-Based Model

A testbed for the analysis and experimentation of the changes in epidemiological networks that ocurr through mosquito bites in human populations.

## Networks Epidemics Framework

Algorithms to perform simulations on pathogens' spread in networks.

## Twitter Network Parser

Scripts to obtain and reconstruct twitter's networks.
