## Introduction

The way humans connect to each other epidemiologically shapes the way diseases spread amongst them. This is because it makes easier or harder for pathogens to "jump" from host to host and continue their path of infection. This is why, our project focuses on trying to obtain and analyse human connections to try to infer the way Zika would spread in a given population and how we would better approach its eradication.

## SIR example

An example of this idea can be seen in the following video, on which we present how an arbitrary pathogen would spread upon different network topologies. In these simulations, healthy people are colored in blue, sick people in red and recovered people in green. The number of people in each state is shown in the colored bars on the right of the plots and the historic of the number of these people are shown in the background of the graphics.
