## Introduction

The way humans connect to each other epidemiologically shapes the way diseases spread amongst them. This is because it makes easier or harder for pathogens to "jump" from host to host and continue their path of infection. This is why, our project focuses on trying to obtain and analyse human connections to try to infer the way Zika would spread in a given population and how we would better approach its eradication.

## Branches

This project has incrementally broaden its scope. As such, we are currently working on various different lines of research, which we will describe briefly here.

### Networks Epidemics

As it was mentioned before, the way humans connect to each other modifies the way diseases spread amongst them. An example of this idea can be seen in the following video, on which we present how an arbitrary pathogen would spread upon different network topologies. In these simulations, healthy people are colored in blue, sick people in red and recovered people in green. The number of people in each state is shown in the colored bars on the right of the plots and the historic of the number of these people are shown in the background of the graphics.

### Social Networks

Social networks have been used in the past to try to predict diseases spread in human populations, although these efforts have usually focused on direct-contact transmitted diseases (such as influenza). In therms of mosquito-borne diseases, we are still developing frameworks that would allow us to understand and anticipate epidemics with this kind of information. This is why one of the main objectives of our project.

### Agent-Based Model

Another integral part of our project is the understanding of the micro-dynamics of human-mosquito interactions. To this end, we created a computational individual-based model to understand how changes in human behaviour, along with weather and mosquito-control interventions affect the way humans connect to each other epidemiologically.
